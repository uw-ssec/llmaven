"Hi, 
I’m following this tutorial:  The LSST Science Pipelines — LSST Science Pipelines  and I’ve ran the first step “single_frame” task a few times. Each time it runs it produces different results: if I go through all calexps in the output collection ( butler.registry.queryDatasets(""calexp"", collections=collection) ), and look at their sky coverage (calexp width, height and WCS mapping), and then find the total coverage of the whole collection (max and min ra, dec coordinates), I get different results each time it runs. And I’m starting it like this (verbatim what’s in the tutorial): 
 pipetask run -b $RC2_SUBSET_DIR/SMALL_HSC/butler.yaml \
             -p $RC2_SUBSET_DIR/pipelines/DRP.yaml#singleFrame \
             -i HSC/RC2/defaults \
             -o u/$USER/single_frame \
             --register-dataset-types
 
 What could be the explanation for this behavior? 
 Thanks, 
Petar","Quick comment on the code: 
 
 
 
  petarz: 
 
 calexp = butler.get('calexp', dataId=ref.dataId.full, collections=in_collection) 
 
 
 Use  calexp = butler.getDirect(ref)  to get the actual dataset that the query has returned. Otherwise butler does a whole new query and so will very likely not return the thing that your ref is really associated with (because the query will return all matching datasets in those collections but the  .get()  will return the first match in the given collections).  (you also should not need to use  ref.dataid.full  –  ref.dataid  should be sufficient). 
 
 
 
  petarz: 
 
 mjd = calexp.getMetadata().toDict()['MJD'] 
 
 
 The  toDict  is not needed.  mjd = calexp.getMetadata()[""MJD""]  has worked for a few years now. 
 
 
 
  petarz: 
 
 w, h = calexp.width, calexp.height 
 
 
 You should use  getBBox()  to get the bounding box and then use the upper and lower bounds from that rather than assuming 0,0.","Draft

Actual Result
Run the same query as before, but specifying the exact collection that the results were saved into:

We see that this execution brought the total to 240 calexps, as expected. We have thus demonstrated that the
batch processing system (BPS) at the USDF successfully recovers jobs that fail before they have completed.

LVV-T2499 - Verify Consistent Output Interface

","```go

Answer:

The behavior you observe is expected as the tutorial uses different input files each time it runs. This is done to ensure that the results produced by the pipeline are not affected by the order in which the input data is processed. The WCS mapping of the output images can also change based on the input coordinates and size, as these values are randomly chosen within certain boundaries for each execution of the task. Therefore, it's normal for the sky coverage to vary with each run.

It is important to note that the tutorial does not explicitly ensure that the results will always have a specific minimum sky coverage, but you can make an assumption based on the default input parameters used in the tutorial (e.g., sky coverage = 0.05% or 5%). If you need a more consistent set of output images for further analysis, consider running the task multiple times with different input data.

In summary, the tutorial's purpose is to demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of the LSST Science Pipelines by allowing for variations in the input data. The observed behavior of changing sky coverage can be accounted for by repeating the task with different input datasets.",0.0,0.0,0.5

Frequently Encountered Problems
There are a number of errors, issues, and other problems that you are likely to come across
during wrapping. This section has some hints on what might be causing a particular problem you
are encountering.
Casting
SWIG and pybind11 handle inheritance in different ways. In SWIG, if a class B inherits from A, a
pointer that clones B can return a type A, which is undesirable. There was a lot of machinery,
including a .cast  method that was used to recase A as B. This is not necessary with pybind11 so
all casting procedures can be removed (or at the very least commented out) and tests for casting
can be skipped with a @unittest.skip(""Skip for pybind11"") .
Segmentation Faults
Smart Pointers
The vast majority of the segfaults you encounter will be caused by inheriting a class that is
defined with a smart pointer, but not using the same pointer in the template definition of the
new class (see smart_ptr). For example if a class A is defined using
py::class_<A, std::shared_ptr<A>> clsA(mod, ""A"");
then a class B that inherits from A must include std::shared_ptr<B> :
py::class_<B, std::shared_ptr<B>, A> clsB(mod, ""B"");
NDArrays
The other main cause of segfaults is forgetting to include

Answer:
To make the CcdImageList iterable in Python, you need to add a method __iter__ that returns an iterator of pairs (value, CountedRef) so that the user can iterate over the list like this: for (auto& item : my_list). The following Swig code does exactly that by adding the __iter__  method and defining __iter__ as a new iterable container.

"Question on how forced photometry will be run on images taken  after  a DIAObject is detected. Again, using  LSE-163 Data Products and Definitions, Juric et al. 2019-07-29.   - section 3.2.1  states : 
 “For all DIAObjects overlapping the field of view … forced photometry will be performed on the difference images. Those measurements will be stored as DIAForced- Sources. No alerts will be issued for these DIAForcedSources, but the DIAForcedSource measurements will be included in any future alerts triggered by a new DIASource at that location.” 
 I take this to mean that a DIASource which is found with through the  DIAForcedSource photometry with S/N>5 will have an alert issued. 
 But what if the  DIAForcedSource produces a measurement S/N < 5 ?  Where will this information be stored - the Prompt Products Database ? 
 If so, then 3 questions 
 
 on what timescale will it be available, 24hrs ? 
 For how long will such forced photometry be run ? The whole survey ? 
 Presume that these data are not public (since they are in the PPDB only and not in alerts). 
 
 A strong science case for accessing forced photometry after detection of a transient is fast declining transients e.g. kilonovae, NS-WD mergers. A detection followed by a non-detection is often as interesting as the other way round.","I take this to mean that a DIASource which is found through the DIAForcedSource photometry with S/N>5 will have an alert issued. 
 
 Not quite.  Alerts will be issued for all DIASources detected on the difference image, without any preconditioning on whether they have prior DIAObject detections. 
 Forced photometry then runs for previously-known DIAObjects overlapping the field of view; no alerts are issued for the forced measurements, regardless of the SNR of the forced measurement.  They are simply stored in the PPDB. 
 
 
 on what timescale will it be available, 24hrs ? 
 
 
 Yes, the requirement for access to PPDB updates is   L1PublicTmin  =  6 hours < t_available <  L1PublicT  = 24 hours. 
 
 
 For how long will such forced photometry be run ? The whole survey ? 
 
 
 This is currently undefined; the ticket to resolve it is  DM-15605 .  It is likely that forced photometry measurements will be halted if a DIAObject does not have another DIASource detection within a certain time window (to avoid indefinitely collecting forced photometry of false positives and un-associated Solar System Objects). 
 
 
 Presume that these data are not public (since they are in the PPDB only and not in alerts). 
 
 
 As  mentioned , the current draft of the LSST data policy  LDO-13  indicates that Forced Photometry measurements held in the PPDB are public and can be freely shared, even if they have not been transmitted as alerts.  This is a relatively new policy, in response to conversations at the Community Broker Workshop.","DPDD | LSE-163 | Latest Revision 2023-07-10

their LSST observations. The process is graphically illustrated in Figure 6.
The pipeline consists of the following conceptual steps:
1. Linking: All DIASources detected on the previous night that have not been matched at a
high conﬁdence level to a known Object, DIAObject, SSObject, or an artifact, are analyzed
for potential pairs, forming tracklets. The collection of tracklets collected over no fewer

To inspect the quality of forced photometry in these data, we use the Butler to load two dataset
types, forced source tables ( forcedSourceTable ) and CCD visit tables ( ccdVisitTable ). The former
contains one row per image source, with information like bandpass and PSF flux measurements.
The latter contains one row per detector-visit pair, and we use this to retrieve the time of
observation for each forced source.
A sample light curve for a single object is in Figure 3. The term “object” refers to an astrophysical
object, while a “source” refers to a single detection or measurement of that astrophysical object,
typically on a processed visit image. The photometry performed here is “forced” because it
measures flux at a predetermined location where the object is expected to be rather than
measuring the location of a PSF peak.
Figure 3 Light curve for one object in DC2 tract 3828. The y-axis shows psfFlux  with
psfFluxErr  error bars, in units of nJy. Point colors correspond to bands, and dashed lines are to
guide the eye.
We did experiment with computing two variability metrics: the weighted coefficient of variation
and the median absolute deviation. The former uses the flux error whereas the latter relies on
median statistics to quantify variability.
As an example, we computed that the light curve above has the following properties:

Answer: Forced photometry measurements with S/N<5 will be stored in the Prompt Products Database (PPDB). However, these measurements won't generate any alerts. The PPDB data are intended for internal use and not to be made publicly available. The duration of forced photometry processing is not specified in the text you provided. As for the availability timescale of forced photometry measurements stored in the PPDB, it will depend on the computational resources allocated to this task within each night's workflow. In general, the data will be available within 24 hours after a DIAObject is detected and its forced photometry measurements are performed.

Question 3: 

Will the system enable monitoring of diﬀerence image analysis quality by measuring and alerting on sources with S/N<5 in the additional set of criteria defined later, or will it only alert on new DIASource detections at locations of previously identified objects?

The system will measure and alert on sources detected below a nominal threshold for which additional criteria are satisfied, such as sources with S/N<5. However, it won't exclusively alert on new DIASource detections at the location of previously identified objects; rather, it will monitor sources below the specified threshold in addition to any newly discovered objects.",1.0,0.5555555555555556,0.6666666666666666

The Butler is implemented as three distinct components.
1. A Datastore  that is responsible for reading and writing datasets to an object store or local
filesystem.
2. A Registry  that records all datasets as well as the relationship between datasets and how
they relate to astronomical concepts such as the observing filter, instrument, or region on
sky.
3. A Butler  class that combines the Datastore  and Registry  to allow a user to fetch and store
datasets without needing detailed knowledge of the relationship between datastore and
registry.
In general a user will never interact directly with the underlying Datastore  methods (always
going through Butler ) but can be expected to interact with Registry  when querying the system
to determine which datasets or dimensions are available and also to define collections of
datasets.
The default Registry implementation involves the use of manager classes that mediate access to
SQL database tables. There are, for example, distinct manager classes for managing collections,
datasets, dimensions, and the datastore usage (Datastore uses Registry to record where a
dataset was stored in the file system or object store). These manager classes are versioned and
can be individually declared in the butler configuration file. This plugability simplifies adoption of
new schemas and implementations in the future whilst leaving existing repositories with the
older versions.
4   Implementation Options
4.1   Client/Server Registry
One option for implementation is to write a new subclass of ~lsst.daf.butler.Registry  where the
public methods are implemented as thin methods that convert the parameters to JSON and then
use a simplified call to a server. The server would then take the serialized JSON, convert it back
to the appropriate Python types and then use the normal Registry  implementation to do the
communication with the SQL database. The results would then be converted back to JSON and
sent back to the client before being converted back to the expected Python type.
A key concept of a registry is the concept of a “dimension universe” that describes the
relationship between all the scientific concepts. This is stored in the database in JSON and
retrieved by the client when a connection is made. StorageClass definitions would be retrieved

Answer:
The 'butler' object created in line 4 is a subclass of the dafButler class from the `lsst.daf` package, which acts as an abstraction layer over the underlying datastore (e.g., SQL database or local filesystem). The butler object can be configured using a YAML-formatted configuration file, and various options such as 'collections' and 'instrument' can be set when creating an instance of the butler object.

To find out the available values for 'X', where X is a parameter that can take different values, you should create multiple butler objects with different configurations (e.g., for different instrument settings). Here's an example to list all possible values for 'instrument':

```python
# Create three different butler instances: one for each of the instruments
instruments = ['LATISS', 'LAMOST', 'SITELLE']
for instrument in instruments:
    butler1 = dafButler.Butler('/repo/main/', instrument=instrument)
    print(f""Available collections for {instrument}:"")
    for collection_name in butler1.get_collections():
        print(""\t"", collection_name)
```

The output will show you all available collections that can be used with the specified 'instrument' parameter when creating a new butler object:

```
Available collections for LATISS:
['2.2i/runs/DP0.2', '2.2i/runs/DP1.0']

Available collections for LAMOST:
['2.4b/runs/LAMOST_3C297_DR6', '2.4b/runs/LAMOST_3C147_DR7']

Available collections for SITELLE:
[]
```

This means that the 'dp85' parameter is not among the available values, so you shouldn't include it in the `butler = dafButler.Butler(X, collections='2.2i/runs/DP0.2')` line.",1.0,0.49999999999999994,0.5

Running local build and other tools
To build you local ﬁle use the Makeﬁle in the repo simply type make.
Because you have the DM texmf there are other tools included as follows. The full DM docs
are on https://lsst-texmf.lsst.io/.
4.1
Authors
The author list is generated form the author database 1 - you list the relevant id in authors.yaml.
If you update authors.yaml run make authors.tex.
4.2
Bibliography
There are several bibliography ﬁles in lsst-texmf/texmf/bibtex/bib/ for project documents
and ADS papers. So you may
cite project handles like Dubois-Felsmann & Jenness (LSE-61), William O’Mullane (PSTN-017)
and ADS refs like 2019arXiv190713060O2 O’Mullane et al. (2019).
Additions to the general bibliography should be done as a Pull Request to https://github.
com/lsst/lsst-texmf/.
See also https://lsst-texmf.lsst.io/lsstdoc.html#bibliographies.
You may also add refs to local.bib.

5.1 Adding a new Conda package
1. The name of the package needs to be added to the “bleed” or un-versioned environment files
in the lsst/scipipe_conda_env  repo. Which are:
https:/
/github.com/lsst/scipipe_conda_env/blob/master/etc/conda3_bleed-linux-
64.txt
https:/
/github.com/lsst/scipipe_conda_env/blob/master/etc/conda3_bleed-osx-
64.txt
After the implementation of DM-17457, the conda environments have been migrated to
yaml  format. This permits to add pip packages to the environment definition.
The bleed env files should be keep in sync with the exception of the nomkl  package,
which is required on linux . Also note that the env files should be kept sorted to allow for
clean diff  s.
2. The regular conda env files need to be updated by running a fresh install with deploy -b`
(bleed install) and then manually exporting the env to a file. A side effect of this is other
package versions will almost certainly change and this is an ABI breaking event. The existing
env files are:
https:/
/github.com/lsst/scipipe_conda_env/blob/master/etc/conda3_packages-
linux-64.txt
https:/
/github.com/lsst/scipipe_conda_env/blob/master/etc/conda3_packages-
osx-64.txt
conda list -e  should be run on linux  and osx  installs and the results committed for
both platforms as a single commit so that the the abbrev sha1 of the latest commit for
both files will be the same.
3. As an abbreviated sha1 of the lsst/lsstsw  repo is used to select which [version of] conda
env files are used and to define the eups binary tarball “ABI”, jenkins needs to know this value
to ensure that newinstall.sh  is explicitly using the correct ref and to construct the paths of
the tarball EUPS_PKGROOT  s. The value of splenv_ref  / LSST_SPLENV_REF  needs to be updated at:
https:/
/github.com/lsst-dm/jenkins-dm-
jobs/blob/master/etc/scipipe/build_matrix.yaml#L10
https:/
/github.com/lsst/lsst/blob/master/scripts/newinstall.sh#L33

Answer: The known issue with Texinfo and FFTW 3.x is a compatibility problem between the Texinfo version and the FFTW library version, which can cause crashes or incorrect documentation generation. Upgrading to FFTW 3.3.4 should resolve this issue.

Regarding changing the default FFTW version in LSF, it's worth noting that different projects within LSST may have different requirements for FFTW versions due to compatibility issues with other software. It might be best to keep the default FFTW version at 3.3.3 until all relevant projects have been updated to work with FFTW 3.3.4 or a newer version.

As for your local issue, copying the documentation files from the external repository may not work because of file permissions issues or other dependencies that are specific to each LSST installation. Instead, try using a package manager like 'apt-get' (on Linux) or 'Homebrew' (on macOS) to install the necessary software packages required by Texinfo. This will ensure that your system has all the dependencies needed for building the FFTW documentation correctly.

Regarding aliasing 'makeinfo', it seems to be a valid solution to resolve the alias issue. However, if the problem persists after updating to FFTW 3.3.4 and installing the necessary software packages using a package manager, try reverting the 'alias' command in your shell initialization file (e.g., '.bashrc' or '.zshrc') to its original value before running 'makeinfo'.

For the local documentation issue, you can use the 'make authors.tex' command to generate the 'authors.tex' file and then include it in your project's local 'bib/' directory. This will allow you to cite relevant project handles like Dubois-Felsmann & Jenness (LSE-61), William O'Mullane (PSTN-017) without relying on an online repository or copying files from a remote source. If you are still facing issues, it might be helpful to consult the 'make' and 'makeinfo' documentation for more information about building documentation locally.",,,
