# LLMaven

This project's scientific goal is to create open, transparent and useful AI-based
software for scientific research. We propose building a tool library, named LLMaven, using a
Generative AI approach, specifically Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based LLM. We
will use RAG as a means of extending LLMs for data that has privacy/IP concerns that is cost
effective for individual researchers who do not have the resources to develop their own models
(or purchase expensive equipment). LLMaven will leverage publicly available diverse datasets
and disparate academic knowledge bases.
